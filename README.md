#  Whatsapp

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This is a demo whatsapp that i have build.
I was given an idea of this app when i attended the workshop at IIT Bombay.
First I have created a tab view of camera,chats,status and calls.
Then I created list using list view builder of default names and demo message in the chats section.
Same I created for status and call tabs.
I also used various icons for indicating account circle,calls etc.
